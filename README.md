# Hugo Docs

Documentation site for [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), the very fast and flexible static site generator built with love in GoLang.

## Build

To view the documentation site locally, you need to clone this repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs.git
```

Or if you already have a clone locally:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```
Also note that the documentation version for a given version of Hugo can also be found in the `/docs` sub-folder of the [Hugo source repository](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).
